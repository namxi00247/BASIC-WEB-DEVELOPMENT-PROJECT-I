                            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
                            <li>Cook the rice (or use precooked rice).</li>
                            <li>Boil the bell peppers: Cut off the tops of the peppers, then cut around the seeds and remove them. Boil for 5 minutes until tender when pierced with a knife. Remove from the water and drain upside down on a towel.</li>
                            <li>Make the filling: Place the plant based crumbles or ground beef in a medium skillet and cook according to the package instructions, 2 to 3 minutes for plant-based crumbles and 6 to 7 for regular ground beef (for regular beef, drain excess fat after cooking).</li>
                            <li>Add the garlic to the pan and cook 30 seconds, then add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, fennel seed, kosher salt, Worcestershire sauce, ¼ cup Parmesan cheese, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, chopped parsley, and the cooked rice. Heat for 1 to 2 minutes until warmed through.</li>
                            <li>Stuff the peppers: Place the peppers in a casserole dish. (If they have trouble standing upright, you can slice off part of the bottom: just try not to pierce into the pepper and make a hole.) Spoon the filling into each pepper.</li>
                            <li>Bake the peppers: Top each pepper with a handful of shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan. Add about 1/2-inch water to the bottom of the pan. Bake 25 to 30 minutes until the cheese melts and slightly browns, covering loosely with foil after 15 minutes. Allow to cool a few minutes before serving.</li>

Sure, it takes a while to peel and dice the squash: but that’s all part of the fun!

Through the years we’ve honed our recipe to perfection: and we think you’ll love this creamy, classic fall soup.</p>

                            <li>Carefully transfer the hot soup to a blender, then blend and transfer back to the pot (or puree the soup using an immersion blender). Add a splash more broth if it is too thick. Return the soup to the pot and allow it to cool for a few minutes; it will become thicker and creamier as it cools. (If using a squash other than butternut, taste and adjust the sugar and salt to taste.) Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 4 days. </li>

                            <li>Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Boil the shells until al dente, according to the package instructions. Drain them and return them to the pot. Stir in a drizzle of olive oil to prevent sticking.</li>
                            <li>Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: In a medium bowl, mix the fire roasted tomatoes, grated garlic, olive oil, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, and ¾ teaspoon kosher salt. Mix well until all the olive oil is incorporated.</li>
                            <li>Make the filling: Thaw the spinach following the package instructions, then squeeze out as much water as possible with your hands (it should feel dry and crumbly before using it). Mix it with the other filling ingredients: the ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, lemon zest, egg, 1 teaspoon oregano and ¾ teaspoon kosher salt.</li>
                            <li>Spread half the tomato sauce in the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch pan. Take the shells one at a time and stuff them with the cheese mixture. Top with more tomato sauce and then mozzarella cheese (we spread them in lines over the top of each row of shells, so you can still see the shell shapes).</li>
                            <li>Cover the pan with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Then uncover and bake for 5 to 10 minutes more until the cheese is melted. Garnish with chopped parsley or basil and serve. Leftovers last refrigerated for 4 days; reheat in a 375°F oven until warmed through. You can also freeze leftovers for up to 3 months.</li>

                <h3>Healthy mac and cheese? This recipe has big flavor with less cheese than most and added broccoli for fiber and nutrients!</h3>
                <p>Healthy mac and cheese? There are lots of implications around the word healthy (which we’ll get into below). Here’s the thing: mac and cheese can be part of a healthy, balanced diet. And this one is all about balance: it’s got big flavor, a bit less cheese per serving than the standard recipe, and it’s loaded with broccoli for a dose of nutrients and fiber. What’s not to love? This one’s on our regular rotation (and it’s 100% kid friendly: our 5 year old adores it!).</p>

                            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook just until al dente, (about 8 minutes; start tasting a few minutes before your package instructions indicate). </li>
                            <li>Cut the broccoli into very small florets. In a large saucepan, add a drizzle of olive oil and heat on medium high. Add the broccoli and cook for 4 minutes until tender, then add a splash of water and ¼ teaspoon kosher salt. Cook 2 minutes more until bright green and tender. Remove the broccoli from the pan (and wipe it out if necessary).</li>
                            <li>In the same pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the flour to create a paste for 1 minute. Gradually add the milk and whisk until smooth. Increase the heat to medium and continue whisking until the sauce starts to thicken, about 2 minutes. Stir in the shredded mozzarella, cheddar and Pecorino Romano cheese and continue stirring until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth. Add the ½ teaspoon salt. (If the sauce is too sticky, you can add ¼ cup more milk to get a creamier texture.) </li>
                            <li>Add the pasta and broccoli to the sauce, stirring to combine, and heat just until the pasta is warmed through. Taste and add the remaining ¼ teaspoon kosher salt. If desired, sprinkle with Italian panko and serve. </li>
